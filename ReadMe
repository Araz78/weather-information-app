First make venv or env in python directory and then install requirements from requirements.txt

Second run apicall.py from python/api/apicall.py

Finally run this command npm start.

and if you saw any npm error just google it.

one more importent thing about npm error is "Failed start script" or is this "ERR! Failed at the apm@0.0.0 start script." just run this commands :

  Delete node_modules folder.
  then.
  npm cache clean --force.
  then.
  npm install.
  then.
  npm rebuild node-sass.
  then run app.
